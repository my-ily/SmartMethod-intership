# 3D Cup Design Project using Onshape

## Overview
This project was completed as part of the **3D Design using Onshape** course requirements. The goal was to design a 3D cup using a combination of essential and advanced tools provided by the Onshape platform.

---

## Tools Used
The following tools were utilized to create the 3D cup:
1. **Extrude Add**: To create the base structure of the cup.
2. **Extrude Remove**: To hollow out the interior of the cup.
3. **Sweep**: To design the handle of the cup using a curved path.
4. **Shell**: To make the cup hollow with a specific wall thickness.
5. **Fillet**: To smooth edges and enhance the aesthetic and ergonomic design.

## Design Description
- **Base of the Cup**: The main body of the cup was created using **Extrude Add**, and the interior was hollowed out using **Extrude Remove** and **Shell**.
- **Handle**: The handle was designed using **Sweep** along a curved path, with **Fillet** applied to smooth the connection between the handle and the cup.
